 - BLoC Architecture: Employed BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern to separate concerns and manage state effectively, enhancing code maintainability and testability.

### .env file (API KEY)

For this project I used .env directory to store my API Key, if you want to use it, you need to create this structure on the root of your app:

````
assets:
  - .env
````

Inside this file you need to put your API KEY like that:

````
GAMES_API_KEY = 'your api key code here';
````
For more info you can check the official documentation of [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) library.
